The marketing strategy Gina developed and executed for recruitHER attracted national attention, including feature stories in both [Austin Monthly](http://www.austinmonthly.com/AM/February-2016/Women-We-Love-Gina-Helfrich-Ashley-Doyal/) and [Austin Woman](http://www.austinwomanmagazine.com/articles/now-hiring-diversity) magazines, a talk at [SXSW](http://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP51520), and an interview on the [Stuff Mom Never Told You](http://www.stuffmomnevertoldyou.com/podcasts/spill-your-salary-secrets/) podcast.
